# EasyFeeds

Heroku Link: [EasyFeeds](easy-feeds.herokuapp.com)

This project is a clone of [Feedly](http://feedly.com), an RSS Feed publishing aggregator. With Easy Feeds, you can add RSS Feeds to a personal library of websites in order to stay up-to-date with your favorite online content.

This project uses the Rails framework for the backend API, and a React/Redux framework in order to handle dynamic front-end rendering in a single-page app.

## Features

### Smart Feed Fetching

With EasyFeeds, not only are you able to browse the library of feeds provided by the app, but also users can provide their own feeds with a feed URL.

## Acknowledgements

In addition to the Rails and React frameworks, this app would not be possible without the collaborators who worked on [Feedjira](https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira) and [MetaInspector](https://github.com/jaimeiniesta/metainspector). These gems were used for efficient and reliable fetching and parsing of RSS files and scraping website metadata.

Other helpful packages used in this project include:
* [Moment.js](https://github.com/moment/moment): Time parsing, formatting, and calculations
* [Ruby Favicon class](https://www.webmaster-source.com/2013/09/25/finding-a-websites-favicon-with-ruby/)
