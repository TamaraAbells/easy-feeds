813	https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/18/911-victims-fund-bill-vote-1422014	Senate to vote on permanently extending 9/11 victims fund	Burgess Everett	<br><p>The Senate has agreed to vote on permanently extending the 9/11 victims fund, setting up action that will put the bill on President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature by next week.</p><p>After Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) insisted on amendment votes rather than pass the bill unanimously on Wednesday, Senate leaders agreed in a deal announced Thursday to allow those amendment votes in order to pass the legislation. The votes will occur this coming<b> </b>Wednesday or before. The House has already passed the bill.</p><p>The moment was crucial for New York’s two senators, presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. They gave a press conference together shortly after the deal was locked in. </p><p>“I am grateful that we now have this agreement on timing so that we can get to the floor next week and have an up-or-down vote on the 9/11 first responders and the health care they need,” Gillibrand said. </p><p>“It’s been a long, long, hard, hard struggle for over a decade. But now finally, finally it looks quite certain that this bill will pass the Senate, go to the president’s desk and become law. And these first responders will not have to come back again,” Schumer said. </p><p>Lee’s amendment seeks to provide $1 billion a year to the fund for 10 years while Paul wants to offset the cost of the spending of the legislation. Schumer said Democrats will oppose both of them.</p><br><p>Both Lee and Paul drew some criticism for blocking an attempt to quickly pass the bill on Wednesday, but they said they weren’t trying to stop the bill but just fight for amendment votes. Lee said he was concerned about the length of the bill and argued shorter bills made the 9/11 fund more responsible. </p><p>Gillibrand called Lee's amendment "unbelievably callous" because it would force Congress to pass the legislation again. She also called on the Senate "to stop these political games and pass this bill now.”</p><p>But Lee retorted that he would have been fine voting on Thursday, not next week.

After Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) insisted on amendment votes rather than pass the bill unanimously on Wednesday, Senate leaders agreed in a deal announced Thursday to allow those amendment votes in order to pass the legislation. The votes will occur this coming<b> </b>Wednesday or before. The House has already passed the bill.  The moment was crucial for New York’s two senators, presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. They gave a press conference together shortly after the deal was locked in.   “I am grateful that we now have this agreement on timing so that we can get to the floor next week and have an up-or-down vote on the 9/11 first responders and the health care they need,” Gillibrand said.   “It’s been a long, long, hard, hard struggle for over a decade. But now finally, finally it looks quite certain that this bill will pass the Senate, go to the president’s desk and become law. And these first responders will not have to come back again,” Schumer said.   Lee’s amendment seeks to provide $1 billion a year to the fund for 10 years while Paul wants to offset the cost of the spending of the legislation. Schumer said Democrats will oppose both of them.   Both Lee and Paul drew some criticism for blocking an attempt to quickly pass the bill on Wednesday, but they said they weren’t trying to stop the bill but just fight for amendment votes. Lee said he was concerned about the length of the bill and argued shorter bills made the 9/11 fund more responsible.   Gillibrand called Lee's amendment "unbelievably callous" because it would force Congress to pass the legislation again. She also called on the Senate "to stop these political games and pass this bill now.”  But Lee retorted that he would have been fine voting on Thursday, not next week. The Senate took its last vote shortly around 1:45 p.m. and then senators quickly scattered across the country before the voting agreement could be locked in.  "This is something that we could vote on in a matter of minutes, fifteen minutes or so, and then move on to final passage. We could in fact accomplish all of this today, before we adjourn for the weekend. This is in fact what I would prefer. I think finishing our work on this bill to protect victims and first responders is worth a half hour of our time,” Lee said.<b> </b>   Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine

"It’s hard to believe she’s not going to get threats coming out of a rally last night.”  House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries also suggested Thursday that the four freshmen might require more security in light of Trump’s attacks, with a crowd of thousands chanting to “send her back.”  “We need to make sure that every single member of the House Democratic caucus, particularly those who have been viciously targeted by Donald Trump, including at the rally last night, are safe and have the protection that they need,” Jeffries said.   Other Democrats responded with rage at Trump’s comments at the capacity-crowd rally at East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C., where he said the freshmen lawmakers “hate our country.” Then he added: “You know what? If they don’t love it, tell them to leave it” — prompting the raucous crowd into chants.  Three of the progressive freshman lawmakers were born in America and Omar, who emigrated from Somalia as a child, became a citizen in 2000 at age 17.   But Democrats say his rhetoric at Wednesday's rally, where he encouraged crowd chants, crossed yet another line as they feared a rise in personal threats against the four lawmakers of color, including two of Congress's first Muslim women.  “The president’s comments are extremely dangerous to any person that looks like me. The fact that her continued to incite his supporters the way his just tells me that he frankly doesn’t give a damn about the safety of Americans,” Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.) said.  “Dangerous, obscene, racist, disgusting, quite frankly un-American,” Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said of the comments.  <i>Andrew Desiderio and Burgess Everett contributed to this report. </i>    Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine

What fresh hell is this?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>2. So clearly this is a town for cats, created by cats—hence the Milk Bar. But what kind of milk are they drinking?</p>\n<p>3. Cow milk? Do cows exist in this world? How would cats, which weigh eight to 10 pounds on average, be able to domesticate cows, which weigh—[<em>Googles</em>]—roughly 1,600 pounds? Or … uh … are they drinking cat milk?</p>\n<p>4. If they’re drinking cat milk, why would they need a bar for that? Isn’t that kind of fucked up?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>5. What the FUCK?</p>\n<p>6. What did Judi Dench do to deserve this?</p>\n<p>7. Can we take away her Oscar for this? </p>\n<p>8. Why does her face look like skin, while the first cat’s face is covered in fur?</p>\n<p>9. Why is she wearing a fur coat, if she has natural fur all over her body?</p>\n<p>10. Is Cat Judi Dench losing her fur, hence the need for the extra coat?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>11. Why isn’t this cat wearing clothes?</p>\n<p>12. Are clothes optional in this world? </p>\n<p>13. Is this cat just exceptionally body-positive? </p>\n<p>14. Are there cat nudists?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>15. Does Jason Derulo know he’s in this movie, or does he think it’s an elaborate music video?</p>\n<p>16. Will Jason Derulo sing his own name, in classic Jason Derulo style?</p>\n<p>17. Does Jason Derulo’s cat have a fur vest on, or is that part of his own body?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>18. Is James Corden doing Danny DeVito as the Penguin in <em>Batman Returns </em>… as a cat?</p>\n<p>19. Are we prepared for the new levels of annoying that James Corden will reach on the <em>Cats</em> promo circuit? (No.)</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>20. Does Judi Dench know what she looks like this in this movie? </p>\n<p>21. Again, what the FUCK???</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>22. Is Jason Derulo kind of hot as a cat? Just me? OK.</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>23. On that topic, why is Idris Elba <em>not</em> hot as a cat? </p>\n<p>24. Why does this remind me of a still from <em>The Dark Tower</em>, just with ears and whiskers?</p>\n<p>25. Again, why would you put Idris Elba in something and actively make him not hot?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>26. Why is Jennifer Hudson’s cat so decked out in clothes? She’s not losing her fur, so that answer goes out the window. </p>\n<p>27. When Jennifer Hudson agreed to be in this movie, was she aware that they would spend no more than 30 seconds using FaceApp to just paste her face onto a creepy cat body?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>28. Is it time for Ian McKellan to retire?</p>\n<p>29. Or was it time for Ian McKellan to retire 10 years ago?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>30. Was it written into Taylor Swift’s contract that she had to be a hot cat, and not a creepy cat?</p>\n<p>31. Has Taylor Swift showed this footage to her cats and asked for their opinions? (Definitely, yes.)</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>32. What is this bejeweled catnip container?</p>\n<p>33. Is it drugs? </p>\n<p>34. Is this a clip of Taylor Swift lying naked on a golden moon, sprinkling drugs onto the crowd below her, in the trailer for a family film?</p>\n<p>35. Is Taylor Swift good again?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>36. Why do none of the proportions in this picture make sense?</p>\n<p>37. If some of this world is cat-sized, and other parts are human-sized, do the cats just run an underground industry below the human’s noses? </p>\n<p>38. Are there humans in this world? </p>\n<p>39. Do they wonder why their cats are wearing clothes?</p>\n<p>40. If that’s a mouse trap, how HORRIFIC would those mice look?</p>\n<p>41. Should we actually be grateful to Tom Hooper for not including any CGI mice in this movie?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>42. If this is a clip of Jennifer Hudson singing “Memories,” can we take a moment to appreciate the fact that James Corden has the exact expression of anyone who has ever been forced to listen to someone sing “Memories” at a karaoke bar?</p>\n<p>43. Has James Corden ever sung “Memories” at a karaoke bar?</p>\n<p>44. Why does James Corden’s cat look like the Cat in the Hat?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>45. And why does this other cat in a hat look so very wrong?</p>\n<p>46. Is it too late to redesign all of these characters and make them way less creepy, like they’re doing with Sonic?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>47. Who is this weirdly sexual cat in overalls?</p>\n<p>48. How many new furries will be born while watching this movie?</p>\n<p>49. Should we just shut down the internet now, before things take a turn for the worse?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>50. Are these leopards? </p>\n<p>51. How do cat breeds work in this universe? </p>\n<p>52. Are all cats the same size regardless of breed? </p>\n<p>53. Why do the cats have fingers? </p>\n<p>54. I don’t understand the anatomy of these creatures at all. Why the tails, if they have human body parts and therefore don’t need a tail to balance?</p>\n<p>55. Where are their genitals? How do they reproduce? (Actually, never mind—nobody answer that.)</p>\n<p>56. What series of bad decisions throughout my life led me to this place, where I’m forced to think extensively about this subject?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>57. Will I ever know peace? (No.)</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>58. Has God abandoned me? (Yes.)</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>59. Why they gotta do Idris like this? Is nothing SACRED?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>60. How does Taylor Swift come out of this looking less embarrassing than 99 percent of all participants? Is it because she was already embarrassing to begin with?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>61. Jason Derulo definitely thinks this is a music video.</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>62. Who made this lion sculpture? Is this a human creation or a cat one?</p>\n<p>63. If it’s a cat creation, do they consider the lion to be like a person? Or a god?  </p>\n<p>64. Like, instead of just building a sculpture of a random lion, is this one an important figure in their history? Is this lion the king of Cat Land? Is he the president? What kind of government are we working with here?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>65. If the buildings are called things like Royal Claws Hotel and Grand Feral Hotel, clearly the buildings were built by cats. So why is the furniture still so big? Can’t they just build all the furniture to fit their size?</p>\n<p>66. What does this shot remind me of?</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Oh, that’s what.

Has James Corden ever sung “Memories” at a karaoke bar? \n 44. Why does James Corden’s cat look like the Cat in the Hat? \n  \n        \n  \n 45. And why does this other cat in a hat look so very wrong? \n 46. Is it too late to redesign all of these characters and make them way less creepy, like they’re doing with Sonic? \n  \n        \n  \n 47. Who is this weirdly sexual cat in overalls? \n 48. How many new furries will be born while watching this movie? \n 49. Should we just shut down the internet now, before things take a turn for the worse? \n  \n        \n  \n 50. Are these leopards?  \n 51. How do cat breeds work in this universe?  \n 52. Are all cats the same size regardless of breed?  \n 53. Why do the cats have fingers?  \n 54. I don’t understand the anatomy of these creatures at all. Why the tails, if they have human body parts and therefore don’t need a tail to balance? \n 55. Where are their genitals? How do they reproduce? (Actually, never mind—nobody answer that.) \n 56. What series of bad decisions throughout my life led me to this place, where I’m forced to think extensively about this subject? \n  \n        \n  \n 57. Will I ever know peace? (No.) \n  \n        \n  \n 58. Has God abandoned me? (Yes.) \n  \n        \n  \n 59. Why they gotta do Idris like this? Is nothing SACRED? \n  \n        \n  \n 60. How does Taylor Swift come out of this looking less embarrassing than 99 percent of all participants? Is it because she was already embarrassing to begin with? \n  \n        \n  \n 61. Jason Derulo definitely thinks this is a music video. \n  \n        \n  \n 62. Who made this lion sculpture? Is this a human creation or a cat one? \n 63. If it’s a cat creation, do they consider the lion to be like a person? Or a god?   \n 64. Like, instead of just building a sculpture of a random lion, is this one an important figure in their history? Is this lion the king of Cat Land? Is he the president? What kind of government are we working with here? \n  \n        \n  \n 65. If the buildings are called things like Royal Claws Hotel and Grand Feral Hotel, clearly the buildings were built by cats. So why is the furniture still so big? Can’t they just build all the furniture to fit their size? \n 66. What does this shot remind me of? \n  \n        \n  \n Oh, that’s what. Tom Hooper, never change. \n\n

Step 2: worry about how your identity might be sold or stolen. It’s the new American pastime! </p> <p>On Tuesday night, my phone lit up with images of the elderly. A friend in one of my group texts had downloaded a viral photo-editing software called FaceApp and run each member’s photo through its “Old” filter. For a brief moment, we convened in horror and fascination over our future selves. “I look grumpy,” one member of the chat observed. “Age has been unkind to me,” another concluded. I spent at least 10 minutes examining the lines of my face that the app’s artificial intelligence had generated, obsessing over the loose, leathery skin that awaited me at 80. </p>\n<p>The next morning, we all woke up with infosec hangovers. “I’m now in the ‘paranoid that it’s part of surveillance/training neural nets’ phase of interest,” said the same friend who had innocently noted his graying beard the evening before. The rest of the internet seemed to be coming to a similar realization. By Wednesday, everyone from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx-zf97XTCg" rel="nofollow">noted</a> old-person cosplayer <a href="https://people.com/celebrity/faceapp-celebrity-photos-old/?slide=7160452#7160452" rel="nofollow">Heidi Klum</a> to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz-J1E7FhzD/" rel="nofollow">Drake</a> had dutifully run their images through the software and posted them to social media, doing their part to feed the voracious content mill. But that’s around the time that people began to wonder where this digital crystal ball came from, and what it wanted in exchange for this brief peek into the future. </p>\n \n<blockquote>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warning?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Warning</a>: Every few years, the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FaceApp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#FaceApp</a> comes around.<br><br>It's fun.<br>It draws a lot of people in.<br>But, it also captures your face along with some of your private data.<br>It doesn't tell us what it does with that data.<br><br>Be careful.</p>— scott budman (@scottbudman) <a href="https://twitter.com/scottbudman/status/1151283963383578624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">July 17, 2019</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n \n<p>Scholars of gimmicky photo-editing software know that this is not our first FaceApp rodeo. The app was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/1/27/14412814/faceapp-neural-networks-ai-smile-image-manipulation" rel="nofollow">released</a> in 2017 amid a rush of face-altering services like the Chinese-owned <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14316486/meitu-anime-filter-beautiful-memes?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" rel="nofollow">Meitu</a> and drew attention for its quick ability to alter the gender, hairstyle, and age of people’s portraits. Not long after its debut, FaceApp faced backlash for a “Hot” filter that lightened users’ skin tones. Soon after, it came <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/10/faceapp-forced-to-pull-racist-filters-digital-blackface" rel="nofollow">under fire</a> for a tool that turned people into racist caricatures. Nevertheless, it has amassed more than 80 million users. </p>\n \n<blockquote>\n<p>Btw you all know FaceApp is a Russian company, right? <br><br>Just making sure.</p>— Yashar Ali   (@yashar) <a href="https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1151311662592532480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">July 17, 2019</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n \n<p>With each scandal, the app has set off suspicious side conversations along the lines of: Who are these people, and what are they doing with all our dumb selfies, anyway? FaceApp is owned by a company called Wireless Lab, which is run by a handful of developers in St. Petersburg, Russia. Their origins are of little comfort to digital security <a href="https://twitter.com/scottbudman/status/1151283963383578624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1151315511801606144&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FElizabethPW%2Fstatus%2F1151315511801606144" rel="nofollow">hawks</a>, who <a href="https://twitter.com/ElizabethPW/status/1151315511801606144" rel="nofollow">warned</a> on Twitter that, like many other apps, the company’s broad terms of service gives it license to use your photos, name, username, and likeness for any purpose, including advertisements. Nor did it quell the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-phishing-email-that-hacked-the-account-of-john-podesta/" rel="nofollow">understandably</a> jittery Democratic National Committee, which <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/politics/dnc-warning-faceapp/index.html" rel="nofollow">sent</a> a security alert to 2020 presidential campaigns on Wednesday afternoon, warning them not to use FaceApp. “This app allows users to perform different transformations on photos of people, such as aging the person in the picture,” DNC chief security officer Bob Lord wrote in an email. “Unfortunately, this novelty is not without risk: FaceApp was developed by Russians. … It’s not clear at this point what the privacy risks are, but what is clear is that the benefits of avoiding the app outweigh the risks.” (A DNC press representative confirmed the message.)</p>\n<p>FaceApp’s predatory nature has been largely exaggerated. The company’s CEO Yaroslav Goncharov told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/17/you-downloaded-faceapp-heres-what-youve-just-done-your-privacy/?tid=a_inl_manual" rel="nofollow"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> that, though its research and development team is based in Russia, user data is not transferred into the country and “most images” are removed from FaceApp’s servers within 48 hours. Security researcher Baptiste Robert, who goes by the pseudonym Elliot Alderson, took it upon himself to confirm these details for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/07/17/faceapp-is-the-russian-face-aging-app-a-danger-to-your-privacy/#11e6bdb42755" rel="nofollow"><em>Forbes</em></a>. He found that the app transferred only submitted user photos (not entire photo rolls) to company servers, and that those servers were <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/07/17/faceapp-is-the-russian-face-aging-app-a-danger-to-your-privacy/#11e6bdb42755" rel="nofollow">mostly hosted</a> by Amazon and Google in the U.S. “While Russian intelligence or police agencies could demand FaceApp hand over data if they believed it was lawful, they’d have a considerably harder time getting that information from Amazon in the U.S.,” concluded security reporter Thomas Brewster.</p>\n<p>It’s a relief to know that the online gag we all turned to for temporary entertainment does not appear to be part of some larger scheme to undermine our democracy. (Though some have <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kxpq7/faceapp-isnt-creepy-because-its-russian-its-creepy-because-its-capitalist-xz" rel="nofollow">argued</a> that late capitalism is a concerning enough scheme on its own.) But the ease at which these face filters go viral, paired with the excessive permissions they seek, mark a new era of meme-propelled information harvesting techniques. The subsequent panic over their terms of service agreements proves that we, as a society, have become riddled with anxiety over predatory online schemes. Soon after the Chinese-owned app Meitu went viral for its anime face filters in 2017, people realized that it <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/1/19/14331992/meitu-app-china-permissions-safety-data-privacy-concern" rel="nofollow">sought</a> an uncomfortable amount of tracking information, including access to the GPS on their phones, and deleted it en masse. The following year, when Google released an app that matched people’s selfies to works of art, some privacy experts <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/is-google-arts-and-culture-app-safe.html" rel="nofollow">surmised</a> that the company may have also been using those photos to better train its AI-facial recognition models. In January 2019, Facebook posted side-by-side photos from 2008 and 2018 for something called the #10YearChallenge. But it was only after users had tallied their likes that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-10-year-meme-challenge/" rel="nofollow">we considered</a> how the massive social network might be able to leverage the information we willfully provided to it for its own opaque purposes. Selfie-centric, App Store–sanctioned data phishing is now a stressful fact of our online existence.</p>\n<p>It’s the same old story, now filtered through advanced software. “Persuading people to do things under the auspices of thinking they’re doing something else has been around forever,” said Crane Hassold, a senior director of threat research at the email security company Agari. “It’s all social engineering. You look back, and the best example from thousands of years ago is the Trojan horse.” Hassold spent 11 years in the FBI analyzing the motivations of criminals both online and off, and now researches the habits of email phishing groups. He traces the same sort of inherent sense of flattery that the Greeks used to invade the independent city of Troy to modern-day information breaches like Facebook’s <a href="https://www.theringer.com/tech/2018/3/22/17153360/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explainer" rel="nofollow">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a>, which used <em>BuzzFeed</em>-style quiz formats to lure users into sharing personal information with the company. “It’s all about basic human curiosity, and it’s very hard to override that,” Hassold said. “There’s a reason why ‘curiosity killed the cat’ is a very overused saying. Because as human beings, we want to know about ourselves, and if someone is offering information about how we can better understand who we are, we’ll usually take it.” </p>\n<p>Traditionally, phishing is an explicitly illegal form of fraud that attempts to goad people into offering personal data via email correspondence. But as third-party companies have boldly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html" rel="nofollow">extended their reach</a> into users’ personal phone data, a more sanctioned version of this technique has emerged. Apps have found healthy business in selling user information to third-parties. <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html" rel="nofollow">reported</a> last year that at least 75 companies receive anonymous, precise location data from apps. And several of those companies claim to track up to 200 million mobile devices in the United States alone. As Facebook has demonstrated, social networks tend to downplay their involvement in such practices or straight-up lie about them.</p>\n<p>Though we don’t know for sure whether the FaceApps or Meitus of the world have used our images for those purposes, we do know that they have developed extremely effective schemes for amassing a giant database of our photos—and, depending on the permissions they request—much more. In many ways, these startups are not unlike the Nigerian cybercriminal organization that Hassold recently wrote <a href="https://www.agari.com/cyber-intelligence-research/whitepapers/scattered-canary.pdf" rel="nofollow">a report</a> on. Over the span of 10 years, the organization grew from a single sole proprietorship that focused on Craigslist scams to a 35-plus group that has expanded from romance scams to enterprise-focused phishing attacks to government-focused phishing attacks. Though the illegal activities they take part in are far more fraudulent, their structure and general business goals have commonalities with many of the startups that bait us into downloading their apps to participate in a single, fleeting trend.</p>\n<p>By meeting us in a digital comfort zone, somewhere in between a pop culture movement and a platform-sanctioned exchange, face-filtering apps enjoy a level of trust that moves far beyond email or phone calls. “If you’re on a third-party website, like a third-party Chinese website and you see some apps on there, there’s probably going to be a little bit of hesitation to trust what those are,” Hassold said. “But when you’re on something like Facebook, or when you download an app from Google Play or iTunes or the App Store, you trust that what’s on there is going to be legitimate.”</p>\n<p>Hassold notes that the apparent approval of celebrities makes it all the more dangerous. As a New York Giants fan, he even happened upon the FaceApp filter applied to Saquon Barkley on the team’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz_Zu01BX6X/" rel="nofollow">official feed</a>. “It’s easy for me to say, if you don’t need it, don’t download it, but that’s not really going to happen,” he said. Like so many times before, predatory capitalism and our own insatiable egos have led us into yet another digital trap. If we’ve learned anything from the past four years, what’s group chat-fodder today might be a democracy-undermining scheme tomorrow.</p>\n   \n\n	https://www.theringer.com/tech/2019/7/18/20699513/face-app-phishing-old-picture-meme-privacy	https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cVQvEBbJEjREANjqoqmkkrU_6xA=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18319179/FaceAppData_Getty_Ringer.jpg	43	2019-07-18 17:28:18	2019-07-19 04:34:20.760017	2019-07-19 04:34:20.760017	  \n    \n\n  Getty Images/Ringer illustration\n\n   Step 1: participate in a meme. Step 2: worry about how your identity might be sold or stolen. It’s the new American pastime!    On Tuesday night, my phone lit up with images of the elderly. A friend in one of my group texts had downloaded a viral photo-editing software called FaceApp and run each member’s photo through its “Old” filter. For a brief moment, we convened in horror and fascination over our future selves. “I look grumpy,” one member of the chat observed. “Age has been unkind to me,” another concluded. I spent at least 10 minutes examining the lines of my face that the app’s artificial intelligence had generated, obsessing over the loose, leathery skin that awaited me at 80.  \n The next morning, we all woke up with infosec hangovers. “I’m now in the ‘paranoid that it’s part of surveillance/training neural nets’ phase of interest,” said the same friend who had innocently noted his graying beard the evening before. The rest of the internet seemed to be coming to a similar realization. By Wednesday, everyone from noted old-person cosplayer Heidi Klum to Drake had dutifully run their images through the software and posted them to social media, doing their part to feed the voracious content mill. But that’s around the time that people began to wonder where this digital crystal ball came from, and what it wanted in exchange for this brief peek into the future.  \n \n \n #Warning: Every few years, the #FaceApp comes around.
